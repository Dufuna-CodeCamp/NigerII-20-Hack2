                    Data security analysts work to protect a company or organization’s computer systems and networks.
                    They are often the only individuals standing between hackers and a company’s networks, 
                    and their talents are in great demand at this moment. The role of a data security analyst is perfect for anyone 
                    interested in the computer or IT field. Most data security analysts work full-time hours, and many work more than 40 hours a week. 
                    The majority of data security analysts are male, 
                    but more women are expected to enter the field as recruiters begin to place more emphasis on diversity.

                    <hr>
                    Information security analysts typically do the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor their organization’s networks for security breaches and investigate a violation when one occurs</li>
                    <li>Install and use software, such as firewalls and data encryption programs, to protect sensitive information</li>
                    <li>Prepare reports that document security breaches and the extent of the damage caused by the breaches</li>
                    <li>Conduct penetration testing, which is when analysts simulate attacks to look for vulnerabilities in their systems before they can be exploited</li>
                    <li>Research the latest information technology (IT) security trends</li>
                    <li>Develop security standards and best practices for their organization</li>
                    <li>Recommend security enhancements to management or senior IT staff</li>
                    <li>Help computer users when they need to install or learn about new security products and procedures</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    IT security analysts are heavily involved with creating their organization’s disaster recovery plan, a procedure that IT employees follow in case of emergency. 
                    These plans allow for the continued operation of an organization’s IT department. The recovery plan includes preventive measures such as regularly copying and transferring data to an offsite location. It also involves plans to restore proper IT functioning after a disaster. 
                    Analysts continually test the steps in their recovery plans.

                    Information security analysts must stay up to date on IT security and on the latest methods attackers are using to infiltrate computer systems. 
                    Analysts need to research new security technology to decide what will most effectively protect their organization.

                Detail oriented: Because cyberattacks can be difficult to detect, information security analysts must pay careful attention to computer systems and watch for minor changes in performance. <br>

                Ingenuity: Information security analysts must anticipate information security risks and implement new ways to protect their organizations’ computer systems and networks. <br>

                Information technology experience: many employers will only consider data security analysts if they have prior experience as a network or computer systems administrator. This experience provides them with the experience they need to keep networks safe. <br>
                
                Computer skills: data security analysts should have an advanced understanding of computers and software as well as programming and other technologies. <br>

            <h3>Courses</h3>
            <p>
                To become a data security analyst, interested individuals need at least a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field, 
                such as computer science or engineering. To obtain higher-ranking or more senior positions, data security analysts may need a master’s degree,

                There are countless professional certifications available to data security analysts, and some employers may require their employees to obtain 
                them either prior to or during their employment. 
                Many of these certifications focus on a specific aspect of data security, such as systems auditing or testing.
