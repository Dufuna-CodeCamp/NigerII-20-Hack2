                        UX design refers to user experience design, while UI design stands for user interface design.
                        Both of these are crucial to an IT product and need to work closely together.
                        Despite being very integral to each other, the roles themselves are quite different,
                        involving distinct processes.
                        Design is a broad stream of subjects and isn’t limited to graphic design.
