        <H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
        <P>
            Product management is an organisational function within a company dealing with new product development,
            business justification, planning, verification, forecasting, pricing,
            product launch, and marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle.

            <strong>Basic Business Competencies</strong>
        </p>
        <P>
            You don’t need a degree in business or finance to be a product manager (although it wouldn’t hurt). But, you will need
            some fluency in business basics.
            For example, you’ll need to know the difference between revenues and profits, and you’ll need to understand budgeting,
            cash flow, and possibly even how to read a profit-and-loss (P&L) statement.
            As a product manager, your role requires you to know not only the details of your product’s development but also how
            things happening elsewhere in the company could affect that development. Additionally, if a stakeholder asks you to
            discuss revenues for specific products over a certain timeframe, or to offer your forecasts for future revenues, you’ll
            need to know how to read, interpret, and articulate these details. Not only will you offer more value to the
            organization you work for, but you’ll be more interconnected with those at your company that might be interested in your
            future products and ideas.

            <strong>Knowledge of Development Principles</strong>
        </p>
        <P>
            This was the BIG QUESTION on our recent panel, and we’ve previously raised it ourselves here on the ProductPlan blog: Do
            product managers have to be technical? In other words, does a product manager working on a technical product need to
            come from a technical background such as engineering, like Headspace’s Ashok Bania did?
            During the webinar, panelist Annie Dunham, ProductPlan’s own Director of Product, pointed out that there are certain
            circumstances where career experience in a technical field is helpful for product managers. For example, if you’re
            managing products designed for technical users, such as engineers, a technical background may give you both the empathy
            for and a deeper understanding of those users.
            <br>
            But Annie, who has a technical background, also said there are situations when an engineer-turned-product manager could
            be undermined by that engineering background. “I’ve had technical conversations that go way too long,” she explained.
            This means there’s some risk of highly technical product managers putting on their engineer hats and losing focus on the
            big-picture strategic issues that they should be focusing on as product managers.
            So the answer, we believe, is to strengthen your technical muscles—learn to code, take online courses on the technical
            disciplines in your field—so you can develop a deeper understanding of your products, your users, and your technical
            colleagues. That’s a hard skill worth honing, and it doesn’t require you to start over and earn a degree in engineering
            (unless you want to as it could be beneficial).

            First the Hard Skills, Then the Soft
            Soft or under-appreciated product management skills, such as the ability to work comfortably with others or excellent
            listening skills, can help a product manager’s career.
            <br>
            But before you tackle those, you’ll want to master at least some product management hard skills. These commonly include
            research skills, an understanding of how businesses operate, and general knowledge of product management best practices.
            Once you have a solid foundation of hard product management skills, you can start focusing on how to best improve your
            soft skills to be a well-rounded product manager.

            <strong>Familiarity with Economics</strong>
        </p>
        <b>
            NYou don’t need a degree in economics to be a product manager (although that degree couldn’t hurt, either), but you
            should acquire at least a basic level of understanding of this discipline.
            Think of it this way: Economics is the study of how people and societies deal with scarce resources that have
            alternative uses. As product managers, we almost always have some form of this issue. We have too many requests for our
            team to handle, a planned launch date that doesn’t leave us enough time, or not enough budget to hire the personnel we
            need.
            Having a basic understanding of economics goes a long way toward understanding concepts you’ll use every day in this
            career. These concepts could include the need for trade-offs, costs vs. benefit analyses, future consequences of current
            actions (think technical debt!), and others.

                <strong>Basic Product Management Knowledge</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                AProduct management is a sweeping discipline. There are many ways to approach product development, so getting started can
                seem overwhelming.
                One of the most important hard skills in product management is (surprise!) basic knowledge of best practices in the
                trade. It’s advised that product managers learn about the various different frameworks, processes, and methodologies out
                there. Fortunately, smart product managers before you have done a lot of this work already and codified it into various
                product management strategies.
                The Journal Blog, for example, has built a page listing of 11 great frameworks for product managers. Dig into some of
                the frameworks on this list and learn the different strategies available for researching product ideas, acquiring new
                customers, delighting existing users, and the zillion other things you’ll have to do as a product manager.

            <p>
                <strong>Proficiency in Research and Analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                Pivotal’s Director of Marketing Ronan Dunlop, put it this way: “Data is vital to a product manager. All forms of data.”
                As we’ve pointed out here many times, your product roadmap decisions should be data-driven, not based entirely on your
                intuition (no matter how well-honed that intuition is). Data can help alert product managers to opportunities or threats
                in the market. It can guide them to the right places to focus development resources, and it can even help them validate
                product and feature ideas before allocating resources into them.
                But all of this assumes that the product manager in question knows:
                <Ul>
                    <li>How to conduct market research</li>
                    <li>How to use (or build) tools to compile and analyze data</li>
                    <li>And, how to interpret all of the data these tools generate</li>
                </Ul>
                During our webinar, panelist Kevin Steigerwalk, Jama Software’s Vice President of Product, made an interesting point:
                “Data can catch you off-guard. You might do your research and think, ‘Now I have all of my data points; I’ve told my
                story and made my business case.’ But then if you present it to someone with more of an understanding of data than you
                have, they might be able to easily poke holes in your plan.”
                So we, like Kevin, believe that gaining proficiency in metrics, analytics, and research definitely represents a hard
                skill every product manager should develop.

                <strong>Ruthless (Objective) Prioritization Skills</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                Bn our recent webinar, Essential Skills All Product Managers Must Master, panelist Isabelle Berner, Senior Product
                Manager at Pivotal Labs, said that one of the product manager’s top responsibilities is to be a ruthless force for
                prioritization. This is critical to ensuring the engineers are always working on what’s most important. But as Isabelle
                explained, this means that “a lot of our job is saying no… to requests coming in from sales, marketing, customer
                support, even our stakeholders.”
                Knowing how to prioritize, and how to respectfully turn down requests that could upset your product’s strategic
                priorities, is an extremely valuable skill. And yes, it probably covers a grey area between hard and soft skills. The
                webinar panel itself was torn as to how to categorize it.
                <br>
                But we believe mastering this ability is important enough to a product manager that it deserves a place on this list of
                hard product management skills. Particularly because you can apply science to it. Objective prioritization frameworks
                are helpful for many prioritization decisions. And we think working knowledge of these frameworks and when and how to
                use them is a critical product management hard skill.
