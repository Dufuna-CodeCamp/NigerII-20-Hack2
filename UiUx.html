                    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                    <p>
                        UX design refers to user experience design, while UI design stands for user interface design.
                        Both of these are crucial to an IT product and need to work closely together.
                        Despite being very integral to each other, the roles themselves are quite different,
                        involving distinct processes. Design is a broad stream of subjects and isn’t limited to graphic design. When someone says “I’m a designer’, it is not
                        immediately clear what they actually do day to day. There are a numerous pillars of responsibility which together holds
                        design upright. Design related roles exist in a range of domains viz, graphic design, textile design, interior design, fashion design,
                        ceramic design, print design and more. With the relatively recent influx of tech companies focused on creating
                        interfaces for screens, many new design roles have emerged.                     </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>UX Research</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You need to step up your skills in UX research if you want to be taken seriously as a UX designer.
                        There’s a lot that goes into creating a mobile app or website, and many of the decisions UXers make
                        are not just plucked from thin air but are meticulously thought out, studied and researched.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Collaboration</strong>
                    </p>
                    No man is an island. And it’s the same for UXers.
                    Unless you know how to code, design, manage projects, understand
                    product and marketing, you’re going to need to collaborate with others
                    in the design process, especially if you want to be successful.

                        <strong>Wireframing and UI prototyping</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        App prototyping is a great way to understand key functionality of your design before being built by
                        developers.
                        Justinmind is perfect for iterating those sparks of genius that come to you in the middle of the night and
                        just for
                        getting an idea of the direction your app or website may be going. Using a prototyping tool can be a great
                        way to impact
                        investment, too. They allow you to test those assumptions you arrived at from your user research, then
                        validate them with subsequent user testing.
