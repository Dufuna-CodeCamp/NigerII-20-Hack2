        <H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
        <P>
            UX design refers to user experience design, while UI design stands for user interface design.
            Both of these are crucial to an IT product and need to work closely together.
            Despite being very integral to each other, the roles themselves are quite different,
            involving distinct processes.

        <H2>SKILLS</H2>
        <p>
            <strong>UX research</strong>
        </p>
        <P>
            You need to step up your skills in UX research if you want to be taken seriously as a UX designer.
            There’s a lot that goes into creating a mobile app or website, and many of the decisions UXers make
            are not just plucked from thin air but are meticulously thought out, studied and researched.

            There’s a lot that goes into creating a mobile app or website, and many of the decisions UXers make

            <strong>Collaboration</strong>
        </p>
        <b>
            No man is an island. And it’s the same for UXers.
            Unless you know how to code, design, manage projects, understand
            product and marketing, you’re going to need to collaborate with others
            in the design process, especially if you want to be successful.
            </P>
            <p>
                <strong>Wireframing and UI prototyping</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                App prototyping is a great way to understand key functionality of your design before being built by
                developers.
                Justinmind is perfect for iterating those sparks of genius that come to you in the middle of the night and
                just for
                getting an idea of the direction your app or website may be going. Using a prototyping tool can be a great
                way to impact
                investment, too. They allow you to test those assumptions you arrived at from your user research, then
                validate them
                with subsequent user testing. For this reason, this UX designer skills is a great way to get buy-in from
                stakeholders
                and managers.Most importantly, though, wireframing and prototyping are a no-brainer when it comes to design
                as they help you catch
                mistakes before things go South and you have a lot of expensive coding to fix.
            </P>
            <p>
                <strong>UX writing</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                Writing is the unsung hero of UX. People speak highly of coding, which is a skill that shouldn’t be
                dismissed, but
                writing is a talent that can be nurtured over less time to create brilliant user experiences. Pick up your
                phone and
                look at any of your apps and it will be filled with perfectly crafted words.
            </P>
            <p>
                <strong>Visual communication</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                No UX designer will get very far without being fully versed in visual communication. It’s at the heart of
                UX. On top of
                that, 65% of the population are visually-oriented learners! So brushing up your UI design skills will help
                you when you need to create interactive prototypes and mockups that will
                have a real impact on users. In design, visual communication covers everything from white space visual
                hierarchy, to making elements look clickable
                and minimizing the need for written instructions.
            </P>
            <p>
                <strong>User Empathy</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                Being able to put yourself in someone else’s shoes means understanding their problems. When you understand
                someone’s
                problems better, you’re more equipped when it comes to finding a solution to their problem.
                That’s why empathy is such a vital skill within UX design. When you’re detached from your end users, you
                fail to design
                for their needs and feelings which can create a terrible user experience.
                <br>
                A good way of developing UX designer skill is to practice those important research skills we mentioned
                above. Garnering
                qualitative data through user interviews and quantitative data through user testing methods like card
                sorting and
                heatmaps helps put us in the users’ shoes.
            </P>
            <p>
                <strong>Interaction design</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                It’s one thing to create an aesthetically pleasing design but it’s another thing to understand how users
                will interact
                with that design. There’s a lot of crossover between UX and interaction design.
                Interaction design is more concerned with how a user interacts with a product or service, which is why
                interactive
                prototypes are a great tool to combine when iterating interactions.
                <br>
                A great way of gaining an understanding of how users interact with your product is, again, by gaining
                insights into
                their mental models. You can do this by observing how they use your product or prototype or even through
                analysing how
                they use competitor’s products (competitor analysis).

                Interaction design is a UI-UX designer skill which means more than being able to add in fancy animations. It
                means
                knowing things like whether your users expect to have to scroll, rather than swipe through a list.
            </P>
            <p>
                <strong>Coding</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most UX designers are multidisciplinary, and in a world that’s starving for tech designers maybe
                design-developers are
                the answer to this need.
                Learning some of the coding languages necessary for front-end development may be all you need. Languages
                such as HTML,
                CSS, Javascript and jQuery can help you understand what’s possible from a technological perspective and help
                ease the
                transition between design-developer handoff.
