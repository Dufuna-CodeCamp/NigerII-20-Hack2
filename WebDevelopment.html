                <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <P>
                    Whether you’re part of an extensive engineering department or going solo as a contractor, you’ll need to communicate
                    to
                    stakeholders or team members throughout your projects. Remain open to ideas from designers, clients, and others on
                    your
                    team, and speak up if you anticipate roadblocks. Promoting open lines of communication will lead to a better
                    finished
                    product, and help you improve as a developer.

                <h2>SKILLS</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Creativity</strong>
                </p>
                <P>
                    Developers are responsible for finding the most elegant solution for the end-user. As you take on more complex
                    projects,
                    you’ll find that there is rarely one answer to a problem: you may have multiple avenues at your disposal, and it
                    takes a
                    creative mind to imagine how they’ll each perform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Logical thinking</strong>
                </p>
                Programming languages operate on rules and definitions. If you’re naturally skilled at thinking through problems
                logically, you’ll pick up these languages much more quickly. As you see them in action, you’ll develop a knack for
                breaking down statements into their core parts and predicting logical outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Attention to detail</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even the most minute typo can lead to a 404. Programmers learn to re-read their code multiple times as they check
                    for
                    errors and look for efficiencies. It takes patience, laser-focus, and an ability to look at your own work with an
                    objective eye.
