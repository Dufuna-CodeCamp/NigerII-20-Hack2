        <p>
            <strong>Communication</strong>
        </p>
        <P>
            Whether you’re part of an extensive engineering department or going solo as a contractor, you’ll need to communicate to
            stakeholders or team members throughout your projects. Remain open to ideas from designers, clients, and others on your
            team, and speak up if you anticipate roadblocks. Promoting open lines of communication will lead to a better finished
            product, and help you improve as a developer.
        </P>
        <p>
            <strong>Creativity</strong>
        </p>
        <P>
            Developers are responsible for finding the most elegant solution for the end-user. As you take on more complex projects,
            you’ll find that there is rarely one answer to a problem: you may have multiple avenues at your disposal, and it takes a
            creative mind to imagine how they’ll each perform.
        </P>
        <p>
            <strong>Logical thinking</strong>
        </p>
        <b>
            Programming languages operate on rules and definitions. If you’re naturally skilled at thinking through problems
            logically, you’ll pick up these languages much more quickly. As you see them in action, you’ll develop a knack for
            breaking down statements into their core parts and predicting logical outcomes.
            </P>
            <p>
                <strong>Attention to detail</strong>
            </p>
            <P>
                Even the most minute typo can lead to a 404. Programmers learn to re-read their code multiple times as they check for
                errors and look for efficiencies. It takes patience, laser-focus, and an ability to look at your own work with an
                objective eye.
