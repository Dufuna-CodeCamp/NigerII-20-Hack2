                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>
                        Data security analysts work to protect a company or organization’s computer systems and networks.
                        They are often the only individuals standing between hackers and a company’s networks, 
                        and their talents are in great demand at this moment. The role of a data security analyst is perfect for anyone 
                        interested in the computer or IT field. Most data security analysts work full-time hours, and many work more than 40 hours a week. 
                        The majority of data security analysts are male, 
                        but more women are expected to enter the field as recruiters begin to place more emphasis on diversity.

                    <h4>Duties</h4> 
                    <p>Information security analysts typically do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor their organization’s networks for security breaches and investigate a violation when one occurs</li>
                        <li>Install and use software, such as firewalls and data encryption programs, to protect sensitive information</li>
                        <li>Prepare reports that document security breaches and the extent of the damage caused by the breaches</li>
                        <li>Conduct penetration testing, which is when analysts simulate attacks to look for vulnerabilities in their systems before they can be exploited</li>
                        
                    </ul> 
                    
                    <h3>COURSES</h3>
                    <p>
                        To become a data security analyst, interested individuals need at least a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field, 
                        such as computer science or engineering. To obtain higher-ranking or more senior positions, data security analysts may need a master’s degree, 
                        such as a Master of Business Administration. As mentioned above, most companies prefer to hire analysts with prior IT experience. 
                        There are countless professional certifications available to data security analysts, and some employers may require their employees to obtain 
                        them either prior to or during their employment. 
                        Many of these certifications focus on a specific aspect of data security, such as systems auditing or testing.

                        <strong>Information technology experience:</strong>  many employers will only consider data security analysts if they have prior experience as a network or computer systems administrator.
