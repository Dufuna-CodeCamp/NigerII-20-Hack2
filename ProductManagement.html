                <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>
                    Product management is an organisational function within a company dealing with new product development,
                    business justification, planning, verification, forecasting, pricing,
                    product launch, and marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle. Product managers are responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team that is
                    responsible for improving it. It is an important organizational role — especially in technology companies — that sets
                    the strategy, roadmap, and feature definition for a product or product line. The position may also include marketing,
                    forecasting, and profit and loss (P&L) responsibilities.

                <h2>SKILLS</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Familiarity with Economics</strong>
                </p>
                    You don’t need a degree in economics to be a product manager (although that degree couldn’t hurt, either), but you
                    should acquire at least a basic level of understanding of this discipline.
                    Think of it this way: Economics is the study of how people and societies deal with scarce resources that have
                    alternative uses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Proficiency in Research and Analysis</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data can help alert product managers to opportunities or threats in the market. It can guide them to the right places to focus development resources, and it can even help them
                    validate product and feature ideas before allocating resources into them. But all of this assumes that the product manager in question knows
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ruthless (Objective) Prioritization Skills</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is critical to ensuring the engineers are always working on what’s most important. But as
                    Isabelle explained, this means that “a lot of our job is saying no… to requests coming in from sales, marketing, customer
                    support, even our stakeholders.” Knowing how to prioritize, and how to respectfully turn down requests that could upset your product’s strategic
                    priorities, is an extremely valuable skill.
