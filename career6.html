                    Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. 
                    They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations.
                    Data scientists are analytical experts who utilize their skills in both technology and social science to find trends and manage data. 
                    They use industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing assumptions – to uncover solutions to business challenges.
                    A data scientist’s work typically involves making sense of messy, unstructured data, from sources such as smart devices, 
                    social media feeds, and emails that don’t neatly fit into a database.

                In demand data scientists typically specialize in a particular industry or develop strong skills in areas such as artificial intelligence, 
                machine learning, research, or database management. Specialization is a good way to increase your earning potential and do work that is 
                meaningful to you. According to the Burtchworks Study, entry data scientists working in the tech industry earn an average salary of $85,143 
                and senior data scientists working for consulting 
                firms earn an average salary of $158,462.
